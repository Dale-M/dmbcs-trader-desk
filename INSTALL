* Build instructions

*** From a GIT checkout

    First, cd into the top-level source directory, then type

        autoreconf --install  &&  ./configure --prefix=$PWD/install  &&  \
          make install

    (you can of course run each piece separately), after which the program will
    be installed at install/bin/cosmosis.


    If you make subsequent changes in the code base, you only need to run

        make && make install

    to have your changes implemented in the installation.


*** From a tarball

    Unpack the tar file and cd into the top directory, then type

        ./configure --prefix=$PWD/install  &&  make install
