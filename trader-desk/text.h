     *  text in a rectangle of the screen in a way that avoids overlaps
     *  and keeps the items as close to their intended positions as
     *  possible.
     *
     *  Thus the public interface is nice and simple: a method to add text
     *  items, \c operator+=, and a method to cause those items to be
     *  arranged optimally, \c arrange.
     *
     *  The strategy is to move all items so that they fall inside the
     *  screen rectangle, and then for increasingly small deltas determine
     *  which movement, in any of the four cardinal directions, of which
     *  item leads to the best improvement in score: the total amount of
     *  area overlap of all the items plus a small number times the sum of
     *  the items º displacement from their starting values--we want to get
     *  rid of the overlaps at the expense of the displacements.  The
     *  exercise continues until the overlaps are eliminated and delta is
     *  not more than the size of a pixel. */
